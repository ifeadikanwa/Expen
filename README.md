Expen has your typical budgeting features such as tracking expenses and incomes, and graphs that help visualize your budget. But it has one feature that stands out from others,
which is the addition of scanning barcodes! This feature allows for the convenience of simply scanning the items you buy, rather than manually entering every detail about the
products! You can also search for products, and simply click them to add them into your expenses.
